# Fault-Tolerant-Compilation-of-Unitary-Gates
This repository presents the circuit compilation of several useful unitary gates using Clifford and T gates. This project was proposed as a challenge in the MIT quantum hackathon, iQuHack 2026, by Superquantum.
The goal of the project is as follows:
1. Create a circuit with use of minimal number T gates as possible.
2. Reduce the operator norm distance.
